Explanation of Props and Components in React:
In React, components are the building blocks of the user interface. They are reusable, independent pieces of code that return a React element to be displayed on the screen. Components can be created as functional components (using simple JavaScript functions) or class components (using ES6 classes). Functional components are widely used because of their simplicity and support for React Hooks. To make components dynamic and reusable, React uses props (short for properties). Props allow data to be passed from a parent component to a child component as parameters. This makes components flexible and enables them to display dynamic content based on the data they receive. Props are read-only and follow a unidirectional data flow (parent to child), ensuring a predictable and structured way to manage data in a React application.
